SAL (Simple API Library) is a Go library for automatic Swagger documentation generation and simple route organization.

You can see a very basic example [right here](https://github.com/1LCB/sal-example)

This library uses [Swagno](https://github.com/go-swagno/swagno) for Swagger documentation generation
